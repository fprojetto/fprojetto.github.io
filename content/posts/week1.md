Most research begins with a question. Behaviour change is a research field that I am interested in and I would like to know more about it. I wonder if technology could help people in attaining new behaviours they could benefit from. That's where my research starts. I will be reading everything I can relevant to to the topic and its theoretical framework so to find a purpose for my thesis.

### Notes on behavioural change support system

> A behavioural change support system (BCSS) is any information and communications technology ICT tool, web platform, or gamified environment which targets behavioural changes in its end-users. BCSS are built upon persuasive systems design techniques. [1]
